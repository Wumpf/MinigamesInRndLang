## Mini-games in various languages (& libs)

### What this repo is about:
* me trying to get my head around a new language
* having fun with something new
* exploring how to realize different stuff in different languages

### What this repo is NOT about:
* a comparision/benchmark between languages
* real, fun games

### General Notes
Writing a simple game usually involves graphics and user input.
However, the standard libraries of most programming languages do not include commands for that.
This means that most of the projects that are pooled in this repo have dependencies to one or more libraries which adds another dimension of difference between the projects.

The games are intentionally different every time since I want to avoid copying from another minigame that was written in another language.
You find more game-individual information in the respective folders.

Have fun exploring!
